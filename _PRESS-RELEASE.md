There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.
  Golf Partner Linkup

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
  For golfers looking to find other people who want to hit the links

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.
  The Golf Partner Linkup will be a place to find other golfers in your area who want to play. Post your target day, time, and location or search other postings to find potential partners. Make new friends who are also golf lovers and never miss out on another gorgeous day on the green.

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.
  The biggest challenge for beginner and intermediate golfers is moving away from the driving range and onto the green. Having a partner to golf with (instead of going solo) greatly increases your likelihood to get out and practice more. And of course, having a partner makes the experience more fun. However, it's difficult to meet other players and once you do, it's impossible to schedule with them. After asking a few times and getting schedule conflicts, you might just give up. There is no place to go to find other people who are interested in golfing at the same times and courses that work for you.

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
  The product will allow golfers to create a profile and pick target dates and locations that work for them to schedule a round of golf. In it's simplest form, other users can come and search posts that match their criteria. In a more advanced form, text messaging will notify users when potential matches are added to help facilitate coordination.

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.
  "Our Golf Link-up app has helped thousands of people get out and enjoy the green while building their golf skills and making new friends. Golf courses love it too because it drives more business and helps ensure their members are playing as often as possible."

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.
  Just search the database by golf course or date so find other golfers who are looking to play. You can also signup for an account so that you can post too.

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
  "I love the Golf Partner Link-up app! I've met some of my favorite golf partners through the app and I always have someone to play with now. I no longer need to stalk people down to try to get them to commit to a day and time. I have a huge community that is passionate about golf and there's always someone that wants to play."

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.
